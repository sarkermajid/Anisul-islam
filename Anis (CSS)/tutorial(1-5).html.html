As Tarik said, we’re delighted to be joined today by Kristalina Georgieva, the Managing-Director of the International Monetary Fund. Welcome, my sister.Kristalina will say more in a few minutes about the economic impact of the pandemic and what the IMF is doing to support countries and the global economy. More than 1 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 have now been reported toWHO, including more than 50,000 deaths.
But we know that this is much more than a health crisis. We are all aware of the profound social and economic consequences of the pandemic.
The restrictions many countries have put in place to protect health aretaking a heavy toll on the income of individuals and families, and the economies of communities and nations. </p>

<p style="color: red; font-size: 20px;">We are in a shared struggle to protect both lives and livelihoods.

In the short term, countries can ease the burden on their populations through social welfare programs to ensure people have food and other life essentials. 
But ultimately, the best way for countries to end restrictions and ease their economic effects is to attack the virus, with the aggressive and comprehensive package of measures that we have spoken about many times before: find, test, isolate and treat every case, and trace every contact. 
Financing the health response is therefore an essential investment not just in saving lives, but in the longer-term social and economic recovery.
There are three main areas for countries to focus on.
Second, we also call on countries and partners to strengthen the foundations of health systems. That means health workers must be paid their salaries, and health facilities need a reliable supply of funding to purchase essential medical supplies.</p>


<p style="color: green; font-size: 20px; " >  We still have a long way to go in this fight. WHO is working every day with all countries and partners to save lives, and to mitigate the social and economic impact of the pandemic.

The IMF is a key partner, and I’d now like to hand the floor to my sister Kristalina to make a few remarks. Thank you so much for joining us Kristalina.

Thank you.</p><!-- inline css use -->

<h1>Bangladesh: End Wave of COVID-19 ‘Rumor’ Arrests</h1>
<p> The Bangladesh government appears to be cracking down on free speech as COVID-19 hits the country, silencing those who express concern over the government’s handling of the epidemic, Human Rights Watch said today. The authorities should stop targeting academics and arresting people for speaking out about the coronavirus epidemic, and ensure that accurate and timely information about the virus is accessible and available to all.</p><!-- Internal css-->
